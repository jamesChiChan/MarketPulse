## üìÅ Project Type
- Windows Forms Desktop Application
- Language: C#
- Architecture design: MVC mode (Model-View-Controller)

## üîê This project needs to set GEMINI_API_KEY by yourself.
Please go to https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key to apply for a Google Gemini API Key.
Then go to Models/AskAIInfo.cs and fill in the key on line 163

## üéØ Project Goal
Develop a desktop platform that integrates real-time **stock tracking**, **currency conversion**, **international commodities** and **AI Q&A**, allowing users to conveniently query market information and quickly ask financial questions and get concise answers.

## üß± Architecture design description (MVC)
### 1. Model
Responsible for logic processing and data source integration:
- `MyStocksInfo.cs`: A wrapper model for handling stock symbols and prices, supporting the retrieval of stock information from the Yahoo Finance API.
- `SearchInfo.cs`: Real-time price query through stock codes, supporting stock information extraction from Yahoo Finance API and Taiwan Stock Exchange OpenAPI.
- `GlobalPricesInfo.cs`: Reads the Yahoo Finance API to get the raw material prices.
- `CurrencyConvertInfo.cs`: Reads Taiwan Bank‚Äôs public exchange rate data (using a crawler to fetch from the web) and provides spot/cash buying and selling prices.
- `AskAIInfo.cs`: Responsible for sending questions to the Google Gemini 2.0 Flash model and parsing responses.

### 2. Controller
- `MyStocksControl.cs`: Encapsulates functions related to stock reading, querying, and deleting logic.
- `SearchControl.cs`: Pass the code to the model for real-time query service and load the query results.
- `GlobalPricesControl.cs`: Handle the loading of international raw material data.
- `CurrencyConvertControl.cs`: handles the loading and conversion logic of exchange rate data.
- `AskAIControl.cs`: responsible for passing questions to the model service and returning answers to the interface.

### 3. View
- `MyStocksForm.cs`: Displays the user's selected stocks form and provides deletion function.
- `SearchForm.cs`: Search for real-time stock prices of any symbol, support adding to my stock list.
- `GlobalPricesForm.cs`: Provides a tabular display of international raw materials.
- `CurrencyConvertForm.cs`: provides exchange rate query, currency conversion, table display and update time display.
- `AskAIForm.cs`: The user enters a question and the answer will be displayed through Gemini Q&A.
